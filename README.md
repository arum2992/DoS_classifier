##This project aims to detect and classify various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks using machine learning models trained on network traffic data. It includes a full pipeline from packet capture preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
---

1. Edit preprocessing.py with your .pcapng path, then run: python preprocessing.py
2. Train the Classifier: python train.py
3.  Evaluate the Model: python evaluate.py
4.  run everything at once with main.py: python main.py
